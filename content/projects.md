## [Lightrest](https://github.com/ajanthan/lightrest)

This is a java library implementing subset of JAX-RS specification. I was frustrated with other libraries because of the size of the dependecies
and complexity involving configuring it for different environments. I wanted to have a simple framework  with minimal size and little configurations
to impliment simple REST service for platform testing purposes. So i have decided to write simple REST framework for java myself.
