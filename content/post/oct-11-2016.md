## Dex
`dex` is a federated identity management solution. It provides OpenID Connect and Oauth 2.0 to end users. It can act as proxy for multiple identity providers as well can act as local identity provider. Connecting multiple identity providers is achived through conennector. It has connectors for well known identity providers such as github and bitbucket. But connector for well known social platform facbook was missing . I wanted to implements connector for facebook and contribute back to community.I have implemented and sent a pull request. It was recently merged to the project .In rest of the blog i am going to describe on how to configure and test dex facbook connector.
